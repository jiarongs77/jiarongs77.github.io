[DoneDeal](https://github.com/jiarongs77/flutter-TO-DO) is a frontend project for users to manage (creat, add, update, delete etc) their to-do list, using the backend [FastAPI](https://github.com/jiarongs77/fastAPI-CRUD)

## User Stories

The following features are implemented:

- **Welcome Page** after app launching

- **User registration**: register account by entering email, password and full name

    - User validation for registration: The entered email address must be in the correct format, and the password must be between 4 and 10 characters long.

- **User login**: Enter the email and password to log in (an error message will be displayed if the information is incorrect)

- **To-do list management**: Displayed after logging in

    - **Add item**: add new to-do items to the list

    - **Edit item**: modify the existing item

    - **Delete item**: delete certain item by swiping left

    - **Check item**: After checking the "done" box on an item, it will be moved to the end of the list.

    - **Item ordering**: New items in the list are displayed in **reverse-chronological order**

- **Login status**: Users won't lose their login status after closing or refreshing their browser
