Some resources I find very useful for engineering and career.

## Software Engineering Career
- [ByteByteGo](https://bytebytego.com/): A great resource for learning System Design Fundamentals and System Design Interview.
- [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/): Compare career levels across tech companies.

## Engineering Practices
- [Google Engineering Practices Documentation](https://github.com/google/eng-practices): A must-read engineering practices for a software engineer.
